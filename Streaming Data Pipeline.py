Streaming Data Pipeline (Optional)
If you want real-time data processing, set up a streaming pipeline to fetch data periodically from the API.

Steps:

Use libraries like Kafka or Apache Spark to create a streaming pipeline.
Continuously fetch new cryptocurrency data every few minutes or hours and update your database and dashboards in real-time.
Example for fetching new data periodically:
"""
import time

while True:
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=parameters)
    data = response.json()
    # Process and store the new data
    # ...
    time.sleep(3600)  # Fetch new data every hour
